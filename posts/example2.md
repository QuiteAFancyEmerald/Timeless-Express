## Overview 

You will notice that insanely above all of the visuals glow, noise, etc. are all done on two singular adjustments layers. Starting with the structure you will want to use Compound Blur > Fast Box Blur > Red Giant Universe Looks. This plugin is my bread and butter for creating highly smooth visuals the only problem with it is if you wish to manually keyframe an effect you will need to use multiple adjustment layers.

Optical diffusion when used with both blurs creates a HELLA clean glow look that you will see in a lot of high quality videos along with your usual simple S-curve + Renoiser. (I prefer this than using your vanilla grain effects it emulates film without the color grading effects which can ruin some footage)
I will often spice things up with Edge Blurs/Lens Blurs at an angle with Renoiser above it!
