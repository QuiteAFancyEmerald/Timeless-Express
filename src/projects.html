                            <p>Slate Desktop is a powerful Windows environment and CLI tool focused on performance, productivity enhancements, shell modifications, and a modern aesthetic tailored specifically for Windows 11. Unlike other modpacks that revert to outdated styles, Slate Desktop elevates the sleek, modern look of Windows 11 with performance and visual improvements.
                                <br><br>One of the core principles of this project is full transparency—it avoids hidden automation, untrusted applications, and the use of untrusted, pre-modded ISOs. Instead, Slate Desktop employs a seamless, CLI-based process to download assets and automatically import necessary configurations via a <code>sources.json</code> file. This ensures that each component of the setup is openly visible and customizable.
                                <br><br>After experimenting with Windows 11/10 modding for a few years, I decided to assemble a collection of popular tools I've used to optimize and design my system.</p>
